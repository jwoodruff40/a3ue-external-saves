# A3U extender blank example - A3U CBA event catalog

Since all examples include A3U's header files, the event catalog header
`cba_events.hpp` is also included.

This header defines the event names used by the A3U framework through CBA-style
event handlers. Each macro is a string constant and is designed to be used with
the [corresponding event functions](#functions).

## Functions

A3U provides a couple of functions used to handle, register and unregister
events. They're mostly wrappers around their CBA equivalents with logging and
stricter parameter validation on top of them. They are:

### Event conventions

- Client events are usually local to the player machine unless otherwise noted.
- Server events are raised on the server and may target specific clients.
- Parameters are passed in order as an array to the subscriber callback.
