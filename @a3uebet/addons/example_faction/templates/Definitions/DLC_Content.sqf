// Note: any line with _fnc_saveToTemplate indicates that the value is being added to the faction template hashmap during initialization of the game
//       This file is structured so that we first define mutable arrays of classnames for each category, then add them to the hashmap in bulk later
//       This allows us to easily modify the arrays before adding them to the hashmap. This is most often done to support "soft compats"; i.e., adding mod-specific vehicles or equipment only if the mod is present
//       See the example below for _vehiclesTanks
