//            - Basic faction information (name, side, flag, etc.)
//            - Vehicles and static weapons (for purchase from the rebel store)
//            - Basic uniforms, equipment and starting weapons

//  Rebel Starting Gear  //
///////////////////////////

// Note: This section defines the starting gear for rebel units, including weapons, ammunition, and equipment they will have available at the start of the game.
//      Any item added as a simple classname will be unlocked in the arsenal, with unlimited quantity available for use.
//      Any item added as an array with classname and quantity will have that quantity of the item in the arsenal at the start of the game, and with each resource tick (every 10min), a small amount of that item will be added to the arsenal to replenish losses incurred in the course of the game.
//      Example:
//            _initialRebelEquipment = [
//                  "hgun_Pistol_01_F", // unlimited pistols available at the start
//                  ["arifle_AK12_F", 5] // 5 AK-12 rifles available at the start and replenished over time
//            ];

//          - Sidearms (pistols)
//          - Basic ammunition for sidearms
//          - Basic medical supplies (bandages, first aid kits)
