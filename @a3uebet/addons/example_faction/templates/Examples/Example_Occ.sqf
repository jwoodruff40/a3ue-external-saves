// Note: the differences between Light APCs, APCs, and IFVs are subtle and most modsets do not provide enough variety in vehicles to necessitate the distinction in many cases.

//       APCs are similarly armored, but generally with light armament, e.g. a machine gun or missile. An example would be an M113 with M2 machine gun or TOW missile.
//       IFVs are generally distinguished by similar (light) armor to an APC, but with heavier armament, e.g. an autocannon, designed for frontline combat support after transporting troops. The quintessential example would be a BMP derivative or perhaps a Bradley,
//            though in many cases a Bradley would be better suited as a light tank due to its *significantly* heavier armor and armament. See light tanks below.
//       Sometimes, the dividing line between Light APCs and standard APCs can also be based on modernity, with legacy vehicles like a BTR-60 being considered a light APC while BTR-80 fulfills the APC role;

//////////////////////////
//       Loadouts       //
//////////////////////////

// Note: Loadout data hashmaps contain all the clothing, weapons, and other equipment that a faction's troops use in the various tiers
//       The default loadout data hashmap (_loadoutData) contains default equipmment and equipment for special uses that are not defined in the tier-specific hashmaps, e.g. traitor uniforms
//       Each tier of troops also has its own loadout data hashmap that is initialized as a copy of the default _loadoutData, e.g. _policeLoadoutData or _militaryLoadoutData
//       Any key in the tier-specific loadout data hashmap that is not overridden will use the data specified in the default _loadoutData hashmap
//       For example, if a faction default uniform is set in the default hashmap with 
//           _loadoutData set ["uniforms", ["default_uniform"]];
//       all other tiers will _also_ use this uniform unless they set override it, e.g.
//           _militaryLoadoutData set ["uniforms", ["military_uniform"]];
//
//       Additionally, loadout data allows the use of weighted arrays to bias the selecvtion of certain items
//       For example, if a faction should use certain headgear at a 2:1:1 ratio, it may be set like
//           _loadoutData set ["headgear", ["headgear1", 2, "headgear2", 1, "headgear3", 1]];
//
//      Important note regarding hashmap key names:
//      The keys used in the loadout data hashmaps are mostly (but not entirely) standardized, but not all that you may see in the templates included with Antistasi Ultimate are required.
//      The keys **must** match between the loadout data hashmaps and the unit templates located at the bottom of the faction template files (see unit templates below).
//      For example, all loadouts *should* contain headgear for the faction. You may see this referred to as "hats", "slHats" (for squad leaders), "headgear", "helmets", etc
//      The name doesn't actually matter, as long as it's used in the unit templates. If squad leaders don't need unique hats, simply omit defining _slHats. If medics should have their own unique hats, consider adding _medHats.
//      This allows for a lot of flexibility for faction template createors to achieve their vision for a faction;
//      however, modifying unit templates is an advanced exercise that should be left to experienced creators. Therefore, for consistency and standardization, the keys / variable names below
//          are the recommended names and should not be changed unless you know exactly what you're doing.

//       e.g. a sniper will user sniper rifles, a machine gunner will use machine guns, etc.
// When the game is started, loadouts are generated for each type of unit and each tier of troops. Therefore, the unit templates define what each type of equipment each specific type of unit uses,
//      and the tier-specific loadout data hashmap determines which item of that type the unit will be equipped with.
// While all unit types have minimum equipment requirements (e.g. uniform, load-bearing equipment, weapons, etc), some unit classes require additional specialty equipment
// The unit classes most often given their own specialty equipment are squad leaders, explosives experts / engineers, and marksmen / snipers
// Note that this is effectively doing the same thing as item sets, with the distinction being that item sets generally refer to the standardized sets provided by functions **outside** of the faction template,
//      while these are defined as basic arrays within the faction template itself.
//      The other distinction is that *in general*, item sets are added to ALL troops in a faction, though their exact composition may differ according to type of troop (most troops get "STANDARD" medical supplies while others get "BASIC" or "MEDIC" level),
//          whereas unit-specific extras are only added to the specific types of units that require them.

// A note on structuring weapon data:
//      The format of weapon data is extremely important.
//      Each weapon entry should follow this format:
//            ["weaponClassName", "muzzleDeviceClassName", "railAttachmentClassName", "opticClassName", ["magazineClassName1", "magazineClassName2", ...], ["underbarrelMagazineClassName1", "underbarrelMagazineClassName2", ...], "bipod"];
//      Example:
//            ["arifle_MX_F", "muzzle_snds_H", "acc_pointer_IR", "optic_Hamr", ["30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag", "30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag_Tracer"], [], "bipod_01_F_blk"];
//
//      - Weapon class name must be defined as a string
//      - Muzzle device (flash hider, muzzle brake, suppressor) may be defined as a string classname (e.g. "muzzle_snds_H"), an array of classnames from which one will be randomly selected (e.g. ["muzzle_snds_H", "muzzle_snds_M"]), a weighted array of classnames (e.g. [["muzzle_snds_H", 0.7, "muzzle_snds_M", 0.3]), or left as an empty string ("") if no muzzle device is desired.
//      - Rail attachment (usually lights or laser pointers) may be defined similarly to the muzzle device.
//      - Optic may be defined similarly to the muzzle device and rail attachment.
//      - Magazines must be defined as an array. If an empty array is specified ([]), Antistasi will attempt to automatically equip the weapon with appropriate magazines. Otherwise, it should be an array of strings, each representing a magazine class name. Magazines will be added to the unit in round-robin fasion; e.g. ["30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag", "30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag", "30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag_Tracer"] where two standard mags will be added, then a tracer mag, and so on until the appropriate amount of mags are given to the unit
//      - Underbarrel magazines (such as grenades for an underbarrel grenade launcher) are defined in the same way as regular magazines. If the weapon does not have a secondary muzzle / underbarrel, simply use an empty array ( [] )
//      - Bipod must be defined as a string classname (e.g. "bipod_01_F_blk"), or left as an empty string ("") if no bipod is desired.
//
//      Arrays (regular or weighted) may be defined outside of the weapon entry and referenced within it by variable name. This can help reduce redundancy and make it easier to update multiple weapons that share the same attachments or magazines.
//      For example, 
//            _muzzleDevices = ["muzzle_snds_H", "muzzle_snds_M"];

//
//      Lastly, each weapon key within the loadout data hashmap should be set to an array of weapon entry arrays, thay may or may not be weighted
//      For example, squad leader rifles might be weighted like so:
//            _militaryLoadoutData set ["slRifles", [
//                  ["arifle_MX_F", _muzzleDevices, _railAttachments, _optics, ["30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag", "30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag_Tracer"], [], "bipod_01_F_blk"], 1,
//                  ["arifle_MX_Black_F", _muzzleDevices, _railAttachments, _optics, ["30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag", "30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag_Tracer"], [], "bipod_01_F_blk"], 2
//            ]];
//     In this case, squad leaders use black MX rifles at a 2:1 ratio to standard tan MX rifles.
//     Alternatively, they could be unweighted, meaning each weapon has an equal chance of being selected:
//            _militaryLoadoutData set ["slRifles", [
//                  ["arifle_MX_F", _muzzleDevices, _railAttachments, _optics, ["30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag", "30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag_Tracer"], [], "bipod_01_F_blk"],

// Note: keep in mind, everything in this section is either overriding what was defined for the default loadout data, or adding data where nothing was defined in the default loadout data
//      Thus, if a certain type of equipment does not need to be different from the default, it does not need to be re-defined here;
//            however, keep in mind that each tier (militia, police, military, elite, special forces) should contain unique equipment and weapons for variety in game play.
//      Additionally, equipment should *generally* improve in capability as one progresses through the tiers, reflecting the increasing skill and resources available to higher-tier units.
//      For example, optics and suppressors on weapons may be extremely rare for militia units, used seldomly or for specific military units, and near ubiquitous for elite and special forces units.
//      Most templates included with Antistasi Ultimate follow this pattern; however, an extender creator may equip the faction however they desire to achieve their vision.
//
//      For each tier-specific loadout data, generally you'll include uniform, equipment, and weapon overrides. The following is just an example of what that may look like,
//            but very minimal.

// The rest of this section would include police-specific overrides for uniforms, vests, rifles, SMGs, and other equipment, similar to how it was done for the military loadout data.
// Note that police unit templates are different from all the rest of the tiers, in that there are *generally* only two police unit templates instead of several;
//      therefore, police loadout data generally does not need to include as many different types of weapons, etc
//      Refer to unit templates below - generally police tier will only have squad leader and patrolman templates, most commonly armed with shotguns, SMGs, carbines, and sidearms
//      However, some extensions to Antistasi Ultimate may introduce additional mechanics for the police tier, including specialized troops like SWAT units.
//      It does not hurt anything (except for inconsequentual load time overhead) to include extra data here, that may or may not be used in the mod now or in the future.

// Note: crew loadout data is used for vehicle crew members / drivers / pilots, e.g. for helicopter, APC, and tank crews
//      Some templates separate _crewLoadoutData and _pilotLoadoutData, while some templates use just one. Again, it doesn't matter as long as the unit templates are updated to match.
//      Here, we leave them separate for simplicity.

/////////////////////////////////
//        Unit Templates       //
/////////////////////////////////

// Note: unit templates are where we define which keys / variables within the loadout data hashmap are used for each type of unit by role
//      They are tier-agnostic, meaning the same unit template can be used across different tiers (e.g., military, police, crew) without modification.
//      For example, this is the section where we define that squad leaders use _slHats for their headgear, _slVests for their vests, etc.
//      It is recommended not to modify these templates (or anything else left in this template file) until you have a thorough understanding of how the loadout system works,
//            and have already tested your changes in-game.
//
// See ..\Definitions\Unit_Templates.sqf for the default structure and examples of unit templates.
